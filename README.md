# pwgen
Random password generator

This is a small program that creates randomized strings from predefined or
user-provided sets of symbols, or a combination of these. Although it tries to
produce randomness of reasonable quality, I have not tested this rigorously.

The program is **not intended for serious security applications**.

## Dependencies

No dependencies besides C standard library.
Any C compiler supporting C99 or later should build the program.

Tested with GCC on Debian GNU/Linux.

## Building

A Makefile for GNU Make and GCC is provided for convenience; the command `make`
will build the program. Alternatively, it is very simple to build by directly
invoking your compiler, for example `gcc -o pwgen pwgen.c` suffices on my
system.

## Using

Use `./pwgen -h` on the command line to see usage instructions and option
descriptions.  You may also use the command `make demo` to see some example
invocations of the program.

For more details, study the source code.
